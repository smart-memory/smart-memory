Demonstration of the Rich Ontology System

This script demonstrates SmartMemory's ontology-aware extraction capabilities:
1. Typed entity nodes (Person, Organization, Concept, etc.)
2. Semantic relationships (WORKS_AT, MANAGES, USES, etc.)
3. LLM-based extraction with ontology schema guidance

This showcases how ontology-aware systems can provide richer semantic understanding
compared to generic entity extraction approaches.
